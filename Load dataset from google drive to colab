This is especially useful when you have a dataset that is stored in your google drive.

Step 1: Execute the following command in a cell

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

Note: You will be asked to sign using your google account credentials. Follow the steps on screen.

Step 2: Run !pwd command to find the current working directory.

# Load a csv file
df = pd.read_csv("drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/filename.csv")
